                    DIRECTIONS
                    <br> </br>
                    <font color="grey">
                    1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
                    <p> </p>
                    2. Add the rolled oats, flour, coconut, 
                    baking soda, salt and cinnamon to a mixing bowl and mix together.
                    <p> </p>
                    3. Cream the vegan butter and brown sugar together 
                    and then add the syrup and vanilla.
                    <p> </p>
                    4. Then mix the dry ingredients into the wet 
                    ingredients by hand. Stirring until the mixture is very crumbly.
                    <p> </p>
                    5. Add the soy milk and mix in. Check if you can roll some 
                    of it into a ball. It should be sticky enough to do so. It 
                    will still be crumbly and look almost as if its still too 
                    dry, but when you try and make a ball youll find its also 
                    very sticky. If its still too crumbly, add a tiny bit more 
                    soy milk until its sticky enough to roll into balls. When 
                    rolling into balls, youll find that youre more pressing 
                    them into balls than rolling, this is fine, press into a ball 
                    and then roll a bit to make it nice and round and even.
                    <p> </p>
                    6. Place the rolled balls onto a parchment lined baking tray.
                    <p> </p>
                    7. Bake for 15 minutes. The edges should be firm and the tops 
                    lightly browned. They will be soft but will firm up while cooling.
                    <p> </p>
                    8. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for a few minutes before 
                    transferring to wire cooling rack to cool completely.
