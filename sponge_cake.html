                    1. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line the bases 
                    of 2 x 20cm sandwich tins with baking parchment and 
                    grease with a little of the dairy-free spread.
                    <p> </p>
                    2. Put the dairy-free milk into a jug and add the 
                    vinegar, leave for a few minutes until it looks a 
                    little lumpy. Put half of the vanilla seeds and all 
                    the other cake ingredients into a large bowl then 
                    pour over the milk mixture. Using electric beaters 
                    or a wooden spoon, beat everything together until smooth.
                    <p> </p>
                    3. Divide the mix between your two tins then bake in 
                    the centre of the oven for 30-35 mins or until a 
                    skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes 
                    out cleanly. Leave them in their tins until cool 
                    enough to handle then carefully turn out onto wire 
                    racks to cool completely.
                    <p> </p>
                    4. While the cakes are cooling, make the filling. To 
                    make the vegan buttercream, whisk or beat together 
                    the dairy-free spread, icing sugar and remaining vanilla 
                    seeds until pale and fluffy. Dairy-free spreads do vary 
                    so if the spread you are using is quite soft try to avoid 
                    using electric beaters. Stir the ingredients together 
                    instead to avoid overworking it. However, if the mixture 
                    is too firm, use electric beaters to help lighten it and 
                    add 1-2 tbsp of dairy-free milk when whisking.
                    <p> </p>
                    5. Spread the jam onto one of the cooled sponges, top 
                    with the buttercream then place the other sponge on top. 
                    Dust the assembled cake with a little icing sugar or 
                    caster sugar before slicing.
