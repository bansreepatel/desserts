                    TO MAKE THE LADYFINGERS
                    <p> </p>
                    1. Make The Best Vegan Vanilla Cake, but instead of 
                    making round cakes, divide the batter into two lightly 
                    greased 9" square baking pans. Bake for 22 - 28 minutes 
                    until lightly golden and a toothpick comes out clean in 
                    the center. Dont make the frosting as that isnt needed 
                    for the tiramisu.
                    <p> </p>
                    2. Let the cakes cool completely then slice into fingers 
                    about 1" wide. You should get about 18 to 20 fingers out of each pan.
                    <p> </p>
                    TO MAKE THE ESPRESSO SAUCE
                    <p> </p>
                    1. Add the espresso and coffee liqueur to a measuring cup, 
                    and fill with water until you have 3/4 cup of liquid.
                    <p> </p>
                    TO MAKE THE CREAM LAYER
                    <p> </p>
                    1. First, soften the cashews by putting them in a medium pot 
                    and covering with water. Boil for about 10 minutes until the 
                    cashews are tender. Drain and rinse with cold water.
                    <p> </p>
                    2. Add the cashews to a blender along with the non-dairy milk, 
                    agave, and vanilla extract. Blend until completely smooth 
                    stopping to scrape down the sides as needed.
                    <p> </p>
                    3. Open the can of well-chilled premium coconut milk and scrape 
                    out just the hardened coconut cream leaving behind any coconut 
                    water. Add the cream to a mixing bowl and beat until it softens 
                    and becomes fluffy. Lightly fold in the cashew mixture. If not 
                    using right away, store in the fridge until ready to use.
                    <p> </p>
                    TO ASSEMBLE THE TIRAMISU
                    <p> </p>
                    1. In an 8″ x 12″ or 9″x 9″ dish tightly line up the ladyfingers 
                    in a single layer. Spoon over half of the espresso sauce then 
                    spread over the cream mixture. Repeat with another layer of 
                    ladyfingers, the remaining espresso sauce and remaining cream. 
                    (You might have several ladyfingers left over which makes perfect 
                    treats for eager snackers or for dipping into coffee.) Cover and 
                    put in the fridge to set for a minimum of 3 hours or overnight.
                    <p> </p>
                    TO SERVE
                    <p> </p>
                    1. Put the cocoa powder in a fine sieve and sprinkle over the top of the 
                    tiramisu. Store any leftover tiramisu in the fridge.
