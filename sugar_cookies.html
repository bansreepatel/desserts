                    DIRECTIONS
                    <br> </br>
                    <font color="grey">
                    1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C)
                    <p> </p>
                    2. Cream the vegan butter and sugar together and 
                    then add the vanilla extract and almond extract.
                    <p> </p>
                    3. Sift the flour into a mixing bowl and 
                    add the baking soda and salt.
                    <p> </p>
                    4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix in 
                    by hand until crumbly. Add soy milk and mix in to 
                    create a big ball of dough. If your mix is too 
                    crumbly to form a ball of dough, add in a little 
                    more soy milk until it does.
                    <p> </p>
                    5. Flour your hands and a baking mat and transfer 
                    the ball of dough to the baking mat.
                    <p> </p>
                    6. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to around 
                    1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, dip a cookie cutter into flour 
                    so it doesnt stick and cut out your cookies. Transfer 
                    the cookies to a parchment lined baking tray. With the 
                    remaining dough, form it into a ball and then roll 
                    it out again and repeat.
                    <p> </p>
                    7. If you want round cookies and dont want to make shapes, 
                    then you dont need to roll out the dough, you can simply tear 
                    off pieces of the dough and roll into balls and place the balls 
                    onto a parchment lined baking tray. Flour the bottom of a glass 
                    and use that to press down on the balls to flatten them neatly 
                    before baking.
                    <p> </p>
                    8. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes.
                    <p> </p>
                    9. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely 
                    before decorating.
                    <p> </p>
                    10. Prepare your decorating frosting by adding the powdered sugar, 
                    vanilla and soy milk to an electric mixing bowl. Start on low speed 
                    and gradually increase speed until smooth. If you need a little 
                    more soy milk then add it a drop at a time so that you dont use 
                    too much. The consistency will be very sticky, almost gluey. 
                    Separate into 2 bowls. Add a drop of food coloring into each bowl and mix in.
                    <p> </p>
                    11. Decorate the cookies and allow to set before serving.
