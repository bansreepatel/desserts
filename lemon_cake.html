                    DIRECTIONS 
                    <br> </br>
                    <font color="grey">
                    1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease two 8 
                    inch cake pans, line with parchment rounds (I cut 
                    them out myself to fit the bottom of the pans, 
                    prevents sticking), and grease the parchment paper 
                    as well. Sprinkle lightly with flour.
                    <p> </p>
                    2. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, 
                    baking powder and salt. Set aside.
                    <p> </p>
                    3. In a measuring cup, combine the almond milk 
                    and apple cider vinegar. Let sit a few minutes 
                    until it curdles (this is your vegan buttermilk).
                    <p> </p>
                    4. In a small bowl, add the 1/2 cup aquafaba and 
                    whisk for a minute or two, until it is a bit foamy. 
                    Set aside.
                    <p> </p>
                    5. In a large bowl, using a standing mixer or handheld 
                    mixer, add the sugar and lemon zest. Stir to combine. Now 
                    add the vegan butter and beat on medium speed until light 
                    and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Now add in the lemon and 
                    vanilla extracts and beat to combine.
                    <p> </p>
                    6. On medium speed, add in the almond milk mixture and aquafaba. 
                    Now add the flour mixture and beat until well combined, 
                    about 3-4 minutes.
                    <p> </p>
                    7. Divide the batter equally in the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 
                    minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let cool 
                    on wire racks for 5-10 minutes, then run a knife around the edges 
                    to loosen, and carefully invert the cakes onto your hand. Remove 
                    the parchment paper and place on a wire rack to cool completely.
                    <p> </p>
                    8. Make the frosting: Using a standing mixer or handheld mixer, 
                    beat the vegan cream cheese and vegan butter together until 
                    light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed, add in the 
                    2 3/4 cups powdered sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest and vanilla 
                    extract. Beat on low, then switch to medium speed and beat until 
                    light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. If it is too runny, add the 
                    rest of the powdered sugar, or more as needed.
                    <p> </p>
                    9. Frost the cake: Place one of the cake layers on your cake 
                    stand or plate. Frost the top evenly. Place the second cake 
                    layer on top. (If your cakes are not fairly flat, use a large 
                    serrated knife to slice off the tops to create a flat surface 
                    for frosting) Top the second layer with more frosting, and frost 
                    the sides as well. Decorate as desired and serve!
