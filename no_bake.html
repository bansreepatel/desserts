                    DIRECTIONS 
                    <br> </br>
                    <font color="grey">
                    1. Place 1 cup walnuts and 1 cup almonds in food 
                    processor and process until finely ground.
                    <p> </p>
                    2. Add the cacao powder and sea salt and pulse 
                    to combine. Transfer to bowl and set aside.
                    <p> </p>
                    3. Add the dates to the food processor and process 
                    until small bits remain. Remove and set aside.
                    <p> </p>
                    4. Add nut and cocoa mixture back into food processor 
                    and while processing, drop small handfuls of the date 
                    pieces down into the food processor or blender spout.
                    <p> </p>
                    5. Process until a dough consistency is achieved, adding 
                    more dates if the mixture does not hold together when 
                    squeezed in your hand. You may not use all the dates.
                    <p> </p>
                    6. Add the brownie mixture to a small parchment lined 8x8 
                    dish and before pressing, add remaining 1/2 cup roughly 
                    roughly chopped walnuts and cacao nibs and toss to combine 
                    and evenly distribute. Then press down with hands until it 
                    is flat and firm. I like laying down a piece of plastic wrap 
                    to prevent sticking and get it really flat.
                    <p> </p>
                    7. Lift parchment paper to remove brownies from dish and use 
                    hands to slightly squeeze in the sides to create a smaller 
                    square - this will make the brownies slightly thicker and 
                    more dense.
                    <p> </p>
                    8. Transfer back to dish and place in freezer or fridge to 
                    chill for 10-15 minutes before cutting into 12 even squares 
                    (If adding ganache, slice afterwards!).
                    <p> </p>
                    9. FOR THE GANACHE: Add almond milk to a mixing bowl and 
                    microwave for 45 seconds or until very warm. Alternatively, 
                    heat in a small saucepan until just simmering, then 
                    transfer to mixing bowl.
                    <p> </p>
                    10. Immediately add chocolate to warm milk and loosely cover. Dont touch for 2 minutes so it can melt.
                    <p> </p>
                    11. Add salt and stir gently with a wooden spoon to incorporate, 
                    then add melted coconut oil and use a whisk to mix. 
                    Set in fridge for 10 minutes to thicken.
                    <p> </p>
                    12. Remove from fridge and add powdered sugar a little at a time 
                    to thicken. Whisk again to combine. If its still too thin, add 
                    another few Tablespoons powdered sugar and beat until light 
                    and fluffy.
                    <p> </p>
                    13. Frost brownies generously with frosting and then top with 
                    additional raw walnuts and cacao nibs (optional). Slice into 12 even squares.
                    <p> </p>
                    14. Store brownies in an airtight container to keep fresh. Will 
                    keep for 3-4 days at room temperature, or in the freezer for at 
                    least 1 month (though best when fresh).
